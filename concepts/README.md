Hooks add smart contract functionality to Xahau: 'layer one' custom code to influence the behaviour and flow of transactions. Hooks are small, efficient pieces of code being defined on an Xahau account, allowing logic to be executed before and/or after Xahau transactions.

Xahau is known and is being appreciated for its transaction throughput, speed and the low fees. Combined with available advanced transaction types like multi sign, escrows, payment channels and even a decentralized exchange (all on ledger, out of the box, without requiring smart contracts) the Xahau has a lot to offer businesses and (creative) developers.
